# Zola Attention Theme

{{ tocAnchor(label="Contents") }}

## What-Is

A *readable* Zola theme dedicated to helping the reader *manage focus*. It is
*light*, *content-focused*, and *customizable*.

## Why

Many website designs push a style too far at the cost of readability and visual
contrast. This includes both trendy minimal designs and early-internet / barely
styled ones.

Have a look at some demos!! :3

## Second-Level Heading

I guess you might have been confused by all that you've just seen. What ~~the
fuck~~ are these colors? Where are the **bolds** and *italics*? **Attention**
avoid font variations in order to preserve readability, but instead exploit
color difference; unfortunately, this would also mean that the theme is not
usable if one has the particular color blindness—oh well, but the colors are
always customizable ~~actually not yet~~. (Here is some `\texttt{}` please
enjoy.) ([Links are de-emphasized.](/))

<button onclick="document.body.classList.toggle('try-retina');">Toggle `try-retina`</button>
(Retina-resolution currently isn't any different.)

`just some code (still in-line tho)`

just some text

`just some very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long in-line code`

```bash
$ echo "Actual code that is not in-line"
$ echo "I haven't figured out how to make syntax highlighting not look nasty in light mode."
$ echo "Oh well, at least they're horizontally scrollable."
```

You can get italics from `<i></i>` if you *really* need to modify the font
style, but *do you*? EDIT: `<cite></cite>` has been unitalicized and given a
different color (<cite>Myself, 2023</cite>). This helps the reader skip
long-and-wordy citations as well as focus on them when necessary.

### Third-Level Heading

This is a stub-text paragraph that tries very hard to make itself look very long
and full of content yet still struggles to fill up even just three lines. But
actually, I don't want it long, so that I can fit more headings into the same
screenshot.
