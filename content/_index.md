# Zola **Attention** Theme

***Attention** is a Zola theme dedicated to unleashing the most of the reader's
attention.* I as the author of the **Attention** theme ~~definitely doesn't
personally experience absolutely bleak and crippling attention issues that
almost failed me a course in college-level writing~~—I mean—*I have
attention issues*. I have some ideas about how to combat attention issues via
document formatting, such as enlarged character spacing, font-choice,
elimination of hard-to-read bolds, distinct styles for text and listing… and
that's the basis for the **Attention** theme. ~~(You don't really need to pay
full attention right now to my rambling as I'm just testing the SASS).~~

I guess you might have been confused by all that you've just seen. What ~~the
fuck~~ are these colors? Where are the **bolds** and *italics*? **Attention**
avoid font variations in order to preserve readability, but instead exploit
color difference; unfortunately, this would also mean that the theme is not
usable if one has the particular color blindness—oh well, but the colors are
always customizable ~~actually not yet~~. (Here is some `\texttt{}` please
enjoy.) ([Self-link.](/))

You might notice that the character spacing in the first and second paragraphs
after headings are larger than those in normal paragraphs. This is to ease
reading at the start and following interruptions. It is also advisable to
*emphasize* the opening sentence of the article.

`just some code (still in-line tho)`

just some text

```bash
$ echo "Actual code that is not in-line"
$ echo "I haven't figured out how to make syntax highlighting not look nasty in light mode."
$ echo "Oh well, at least they're horizontally scrollable."
```

```
\begin{Verbatim}
Here is some code that should not be highlighted but still is.
\end{Verbatim}
```

(In the above case, I was using `<i>` and `</i>` to get actual italics. So yeah,
that's a workaround if you *really* need font styling.)
