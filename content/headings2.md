# Another Headings Demo :3

{{ tocAnchor(label="Contents") }}

## Uh… How to start… (h2)

### Let's talk about the design choices (h3)

#### My quirks… (h4)

These headings look like what they do as a result of compromises made between a
plethora of my preferred choices that change over time. Not years or months.
*Minutes*. The different versions of myself apparently prefer different UI/UX.
The current headers is the most clear as in they have graduated font sizes as
well as alternating serifness, style, and weight. The default color is the same
as that of `*italics*`, or `<em>...</em>` elements, to provide differentiation
from the text; other colors are that of `**bold**` or `<strong>...</strong>`,
then `<cite>...</cite>`, then body-text color (which *intentionally reduces
contrast* to give more focus to the bodies of text).

## Another H2 to give you an idea of the margins
