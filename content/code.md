# Formatting Code

`Inline code` is boxed unless under full minimalism (can be rotated by clicking
the `min` button). `Two inline segments are easily distinguishable from a long
inline segment broken into more than one line by the presence or lack thereof
of a side border.`

## This is an unhighlighted code block

```
echo Hello, world!
```

## This is a highlighted code block

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world; long lines scrolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll");
}
```

Code blocks don't yet work well under light mode.
